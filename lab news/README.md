## Cluster Tracker is live! (10/1/2021)
We sent [cluster tracker](https://clustertracker.gi.ucsc.edu) into the world today! Cluster tracker is a tool for exploring the geographic spread of SARS-CoV-2 across the US. Our [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/RussCorbett/status/1443983255040978949) explains the tool and provides information about its usage. 
  

## We have a new website (9/11/2021)
Welcome to the newly redesigned Corbett-Detig lab website! Take a look around. Maybe [figure out what filetype you are](https://corbett-lab.github.io/what_file_type/)? [Go meet the dogs](https://corbett-lab.github.io/the%20doggies%20(&%20others)/), or [the people](https://corbett-lab.github.io/People/).
