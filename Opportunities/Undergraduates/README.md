# Undergraduates 
UCSC undergrads who are interested in gaining some research experience in evolutionary genomics should contact me. Undergraduates need not have any specific skills or research experience. Just be excited to learn. If you do choose to contact me, please include a copy of your resume/CV, try to read through some of our publications and come prepared with questions!
