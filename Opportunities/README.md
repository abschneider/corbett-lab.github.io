# Opportunities

In general, research in my group focuses on addressing longstanding questions in evolutionary genetics often through developing novel bioinformatic and genomic methods. I am particularly interested in recruiting scientists with experience using scripting and/or programming languages. In addition, experience working with Drosophila and with basic molecular biology techniques is highly desirable. The most important prerequisite, however, is a passion for evolutionary genomics. If youâ€™re interested in joining my group, please get in touch via email to rucorbet@ucsc.edu.
