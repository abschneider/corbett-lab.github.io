# Opportunities
In general, research in my group focuses on addressing longstanding questions in evolutionary genetics often through developing novel bioinformatic and genomic methods. I am particularly interested in recruiting scientists with experience using scripting and/or programming languages. In addition, experience with molecular biology techniques is highly desirable. The most important prerequisite, is a passion for evolutionary genomics. If youâ€™re interested in joining my group, please get in touch via email to rucorbet@ucsc.edu.  

## Graduate Students
I will be accepting graduate students through the Bioinformatics program at UCSC. More information about this graduate program can be found [here](https://grad.soe.ucsc.edu/bmeb). Interested prospective students are encouraged to contact me to discuss their interest in joining my lab and to discuss potential projects prior to applying to the program.
