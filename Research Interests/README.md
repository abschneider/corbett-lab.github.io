# Research Interests
  
Research in the lab focuses on a broad range of questions in evolutionary genomics. Much of our work is at the interface of genomics, evolutionary biology, computer science and statistics. 
 
## SARS-CoV-2 Phylogenomics
  
  Our group has a strong focus on tool development and applications for SARS-CoV-2 phylogenomics, based on a powerful mutation annotated tree protobuf format. Our utilities cover purposes including [phylogenetic placement](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-021-00862-7){:target="_blank"}, [tree manipulation](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/advance-article/doi/10.1093/molbev/msab264/6361626){:target="_blank"}, and [recombination detection](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.04.455157v1){:target="_blank"}. We're currently working on additional optimizations of our tools and the tree structure, developing downstream applications, and extending these tools and downstream analyses to new vial and bacterial pathogens.
